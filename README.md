# 🎬 Movie Ticket Reservation System (MTRS)

A simple command-line based **Movie Ticket Reservation System** built using **C++**. This project allows users to view available movies, check seat availability, and book movie tickets. It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts like classes, file handling, and user interaction in a console environment.
